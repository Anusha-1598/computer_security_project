Domain of Interest: 
**Secure Collaboration Tool For Students**

**Introduction:**
Secure collaboration tool for students are crucial in fast-paced learning environment. These solutions facilitate smooth interaction while safeguarding data privacy by enabling efficient file sharing, real-time communication, and project management. These application enhance learning outcomes and promotes inclusion by connecting with educational materials and offering easy navigation, user-friendly interfaces. They play a vital role in facilitating remote and hybrid learning methods and ensuring that students academic and personal data is protected by strong security protocols. Secure collaboration apps will become increasingly important in todays classroom as digital solutions develop, spurring creativity and improving the educational experiences for students.


**Overview:**
This project provides students with a safe platform for document collaboration that includes role-based access control, file management, and real-time editing. By providing a user-friendly platform that improves security, privacy, and the collaborative experience overall, it guarantees successful cooperation.

**Technologies Used:**
Back-end - Python (Flask) 
Front-end - React.js 
Database - SQLite 
Authentication - JSON
Libraries - Bcrypt, Flask-JWT-Extended

**Possible cybersecurity threats and mitigation:**
1) SQL Injection - A cyberattack known as SQL Injection uses vulnerabilities in a web application's input processing to insert malicious SQL code, which permits unauthorized access to, alteration of, or deletion of database data. This kind of attack can be avoided by properly sanitizing input and by utilizing prepared statements and parameterized queries.
2) Data Breaches and unauthorized access - Robust security measures such as encryption, access controls, and regular security evaluations are crucial in averting data breaches, which entail unauthorized access or theft of sensitive information and can lead to identity theft, financial harm, and damage to reputation. These breaches may arise from insider threats, physical theft, or cyberattacks.
3) Authentication attacks - Authentication attacks encompass unauthorized efforts to breach the security measures of a system's verification processes, like passwords, tokens, or biometric data, with the goal of accessing confidential data or resources. These attacks include tactics such as brute force attacks, phishing, and credential stuffing, and can be countered through measures like implementing robust passwords, employing multi-factor authentication, monitoring system activity, and educating users on phishing risks
4) Man-In-The-Middle: An attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties.
  it can be avoided by Use HTTPS for encrypted communication.
5) Cross Site Scripting (XSS) :Injection of malicious scripts into webpages viewed by others.
    It can be stoped by Validate and sanitize inputs. and Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
7) Denial of Service attacks (DoS) : Overwhelming a system with illegitimate requests to make it unavailable.
   It can be stoped by Implement rate limiting
9) Insecure File Uploads
10) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
