Domain of Interest: 
**Secure Collaboration Tool For Students**

**Introduction:**


**Overview:**
This project provides students with a safe platform for document collaboration that includes role-based access control, file management, and real-time editing. By providing a user-friendly platform that improves security, privacy, and the collaborative experience overall, it guarantees successful cooperation.

**Technologies Used:**
Back-end - Python (Flask) 
Front-end - React.js 
Database - SQLite 
Authentication - JSON
Libraries - Bcrypt, Flask-JWT-Extended

**Possible cybersecurity threats and mitigation:**
1) SQL Injection 
2) Data Breaches and unauthorized access
3) Authentication attacks
4) Man-In-The-Middle: An attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties.
  it can be avoided by Use HTTPS for encrypted communication.
5) Cross Site Scripting (XSS) :Injection of malicious scripts into webpages viewed by others.
    It can be stoped by Validate and sanitize inputs. and Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
7) Denial of Service attacks (DoS) : Overwhelming a system with illegitimate requests to make it unavailable.
   It can be stoped by Implement rate limiting
9) Insecure File Uploads
10) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
